# Hi, I'm Leon  
I'm a full-stack developer with experience building modern, responsive, and interactive applications. Most of my work is based on the **MERN stack**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and enhanced with libraries such as **Framer Motion**.  
I'm currently expanding my skills into **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, **React Native**, and exploring **Java** for backend development. I enjoy solving real-world problems, learning continuously, and delivering clean, maintainable solutions.
